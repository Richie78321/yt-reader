# yt-reader
A web-application that converts YouTube videos into a reader-friendly format.

## Contributing
This web-app has several node package dependencies. These must be installed when building a local copy of the application. This can be done by calling `npm install` in the project terminal.
To run the server and client concurrently while developing, use `npm run dev`. This will start both the client and the server, both of which will auto-update when changes are made.
